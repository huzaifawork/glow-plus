# Glow+ — Session Handoff

**Read this first, then `TASKS.md`.** Written 2026-08-23 to carry context into a fresh chat.

---

## 1. What this project is

Glow+ is a salon loyalty/rewards platform. A client (Fiverr, username `joziilunga`) delivered a part-built codebase and a requirements doc, and hired me to finish, secure, test and deploy it.

**Contract:** $600 total, split into two $300 orders.
- **Order 1 (current): backend + website.**
- **Order 2 (later): mobile app.**
- **Out of scope entirely:** App Store / Play Store publishing, code signing, developer fees.

## 2. Scope rules — important

- **Work on the backend and website only.** Do NOT edit `glow-plus-mobile app/` — that's Order 2. Treat it as **read-only reference** for API contracts.
- **But** the backend must be built so the future React Native app connects with **zero backend rework** — token-only auth, refresh tokens, stable JSON error envelope, genuinely public endpoints, and consumer endpoints matching the shapes the app already expects in `glow-plus-mobile app/src/api/client.js`.
- **Deployment target: Vercel for BOTH frontend and backend** (user's decision — do not re-argue it). Because Vercel runs the backend serverless, cron jobs must be converted to Vercel Cron, Prisma needs pooled connections, etc. See TASKS.md Phase 8.

## 3. Working agreement — follow this strictly

Per task: **implement → test by actually running it → record evidence → tick the box in `TASKS.md` → commit and push to GitHub referencing the task number.** No batching. No "test everything at the end."

- **Backend task** = call the real endpoint against real Postgres; verify the DB row changed AND the unauthorized case is refused.
- **Frontend task** = load in a browser, click the flow against the running backend, check the network call, the error state, and mobile width.
- **Keep dev servers running** in the background the whole session so the user can test in their own browser too. After each task, tell them exactly what to click or call.
- **Do not start work until the user says go.** They coordinate with a collaborator first.

Why strict: the exact problem we were hired to fix is *"functionality that exists vs. functionality that's been validated."*

## 4. Environment — CURRENT STATE (updated 2026-08-23, end of session 2)

| Thing | Status |
|---|---|
| Docker Desktop | ✅ Running. ⚠️ `docker` is on **no** PATH — not Git Bash's, not PowerShell's. Call it by full path: `& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\DockerDesktop\resources\bin\docker.exe"` |
| Postgres | ✅ `docker-postgres-1`, Postgres 16.15, port **5433**, db `glowplus`. **Migrated — 11 tables + `_prisma_migrations`** (was 0 applied) |
| Backend | ✅ **Compiles (0 TS errors) and runs on :4000**, 34 routes mapped, Prisma connected |
| Website | ✅ Runs on :3000 (`glow-plus-frontend`, `npm start`) |
| Stripe CLI | ✅ Forwarding verified; **webhook now returns 200** (was 400 on everything — see F19) |
| Tests | ✅ Jest configured, **8 passing** (`npm test`) |
| Seed | ✅ `npm run seed` — idempotent, local-DB-guarded |
| Git | ✅ Repo live at **https://github.com/huzaifawork/glow-plus** (private), pushed |
| Node / npm | v24.11.1 / 11.6.2 |

**Restart everything:**
```
# Postgres (if down)
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\DockerDesktop\resources\bin\docker.exe" compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres
# Backend  (from website/website/glow-plus-backend/glow-plus-backend)
npm run start:dev
# Website  (from website/website/glow-plus-frontend)
npm start
# Stripe   (from website/website)
./stripe.exe listen --api-key <STRIPE_SECRET_KEY from .env> --forward-to localhost:4000/billing/webhook
```

**Test credentials** (`npm run seed`): `merchant@glowplus.test / Merchant123!` · `consumer@glowplus.test / Consumer123!`
**Helper:** `./scripts/api.sh merchant GET /bookings` · `./scripts/api.sh consumer GET /bookings/me` · `./scripts/api.sh reset`

⚠️ **`nest start --watch` does not reload `.env`.** After changing it, kill whatever holds :4000 and restart — stopping the npm wrapper can orphan the node child (`EADDRINUSE`):
```
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 4000 -State Listen | %{ Stop-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess -Force }
```

## 3b. Client account access — NEW

**The client has given access to Stripe, Resend and Hostinger.** Testing that previously needed the client no longer does.

- **Stripe** — key in `.env` is **`sk_test_` (test mode)**, so experiments cannot move real money. Webhook forwarding works end to end.
- **Resend** — key is live and valid, but **no domain is verified** (`GET /domains` → `[]`), so `onboarding@resend.dev` still delivers **only to the Resend account owner's address**. T6 was deferred by agreement to whenever T19/T20 (the email tasks) are done.
- **Hostinger** — a domain is available. Verifying it in Resend (T60) is mostly DNS records and would lift the "self-addressed only" ceiling for **every** email task. Worth pulling forward when email work starts.

⚠️ **Never paste keys into chat.** Put them straight into the gitignored `.env`; they can be read from disk.

## 6. Critical findings (all verified in the files, not assumed)

| # | Finding |
|---|---|
| **F14** | **The backend source does not compile.** `nest start` fails with 7 TS2307 errors. It is not merely untested — it does not build. |
| **F15** | `bookings/` and `business-hours/` exist ONLY at `src/modules/booking/src/modules/…` — an unzipped delivery dumped in with its full path preserved, so every relative import resolves to nothing. There is **no** top-level `src/modules/bookings/`. |
| **F1** | `BookingsModule` / `BusinessHoursModule` are **never imported** in `app.module.ts` — confirmed at runtime, zero booking routes registered. |
| **F2** | **Booking/BusinessHours tables don't exist in the DB.** The schema is split across two files; the only migration creates 9 tables, none of them Booking. **This is why the client says booking "was never run against real Postgres" — it could not have worked.** |
| **F3** | **Rate limiting is applied to nothing.** `rateLimit.middleware.ts` has zero references. The client believes `/auth/login` is protected; it is not. |
| **F4** | Nothing writes to the `Redemption` table. |
| **F5** | No password-reset code exists at all. |
| **F6** | `MerchantStaff` table exists in schema + migration, but **zero code uses it**. |
| **F7** | `/admin/*` has no guard — the code comments admit it. |
| **F8** | `expirePoints.job.ts` writes `data: {}` — a literal no-op. |
| **F9** | **The website is an AI-generated artifact prototype, not an app** — 0 `fetch` calls in 1,932 lines, 0 password fields, data layer is `window.storage` which doesn't exist in real browsers. It **fails silently**: renders fine, saves nothing. |
| **F10** | The original developer's own `glow-plus-frontend/README.md` says the portal/dashboard need "their own, much bigger buildout." |
| **F11** | Email provider **does** support Resend (`EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend` is already set in `.env`). Until a domain is verified, Resend only delivers to the account owner's own address. |
| **F12** | JWT is hand-rolled HS256, fixed 7-day, **no refresh token**. |
| **F13** | No `/health` endpoint. |

**The design is a genuine asset** — 6 complete views, ~247 lines CSS, 11 render functions, and **8 languages including Arabic with RTL**. The rebuild is *"swap the data layer, keep the design,"* not a redesign.

## 7. Where the client's doc is wrong

Its 23-item priority list is **accurate and complete for the backend**. But:
- It assumes the frontend works — only 2 of 23 items touch it, both presupposing it's done.
- It implies M-Pesa/Daraja exists ("the webhook needs IP allowlisting") — **there is no M-Pesa code in the repo at all.** That's a from-scratch build.

These two are the biggest hidden-scope items. The user has been advised to raise them with the client.

## 8. EXACTLY where to resume — **START PHASE 1 AT T15**

**Session 2 (2026-08-23) finished Phase 0 and the first half of Phase 1.**

✅ **Done, tested and pushed:** T1, T3, T4, T5, T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, **T13, T14**
⏭️ **Deliberately skipped:** T2 (cosmetic nesting), T12 (Playwright — no UI to test until Phase 5)
⏸️ **Deferred by agreement:** T6 (Resend send — do it with T19/T20)
🟡 **Partly done early:** T27 (JWT secret rotated because it was live-exploitable)

➡️ **NEXT: T15 — `GET /health`**, then **T16 — global exception filter**. That completes Phase 1.
Then Phase 2 (T17–T20), which is the client's stated priority #1.

**Everything needed to test is already working**: Postgres migrated, backend compiling and running, seed data, an auth helper, Jest, Stripe forwarding. A new session should be able to start coding T15 immediately after starting the three servers.

**New findings from session 2** (all verified by running the code, not by reading it):

| # | Finding |
|---|---|
| **F19** | **No Stripe webhook had ever been processed successfully.** `billing.controller.ts` reads `req.rawBody`, but Nest's global JSON parser consumed the stream before `billing.module.ts`'s `express.raw()` ran, so `req.rawBody` was always `undefined` and **every** event failed signature verification with 400. Fixed with `rawBody: true` on `NestFactory.create()`. Verified 4×400 → 4×200. Affects T17, T20; T57 must re-verify under Vercel. |
| **F20** | **`JWT_SECRET` in `.env` was the literal placeholder from `.env.example`** — a published string. A hand-forged `role:'admin'` token was **accepted (200)** by the running API. Rotated to 48 random bytes; forged token now 401. |
| **F21** | **T13's own description was wrong**: the booking modules' relative imports were never broken. They were always written for `src/modules/bookings/` — they simply weren't at that path. T13 was a pure move, no import rewriting. |
| **F22** | `src/modules/points/` and `src/modules/redemptions/` are **empty placeholder directories** (0 files) — corroborates [F4]. The `{prisma,src` folder is a failed `mkdir -p` brace expansion, also all empty, untracked by git. |
| **F23** | `prisma/seed.ts` sits outside tsconfig's `rootDir` (`./src`), so watch builds emitted `prisma/seed.js` in place. Added `exclude: [..., "prisma"]` and gitignored `prisma/*.js`. |

**Note on merchant booking routes:** they are deliberately **not** behind `RequireActiveSubscription` — it's path-based and `bookings/*` mixes consumer and merchant routes, so a blanket rule would break consumer booking. Flagged for T29's authorization audit.

## 9. RISK REGISTER — things that could cause trouble

Ranked by how much damage they can do. Items 1–3 are commercial, not technical.

### R1 — The desktop app does not exist, but $600 was priced on "two apps"
The docx has a whole section 6, *"Mobile and Desktop Applications"*, stating **"The product includes mobile and desktop applications"** and **"Neither the mobile nor desktop application has completed the actual App Store, Google Play Store, or code-signing process."**

**Verified: there is no desktop app anywhere in the delivery.** No Electron, no Tauri, no desktop package.json. The only client is one Expo app whose `app.json` targets **iOS and Android only**.

This matters because on 2026-08-19 the price was raised from $400 to $600 on the stated basis that *"there are actually two separate apps involved."* Only one app was delivered. **Clarify with the client what the second application is before Order 2** — it may be undelivered, may not exist, or "the website" may have been what was meant.

### R2 — The website is not built, and the client believes it is
See [F9][F10]. Phase 5 is the largest block of work in the project and appears nowhere on the client's 23-item list. Absorbing it silently means doing a large unpaid build inside a $300 order.

### R3 — M-Pesa/Daraja does not exist
The docx says its webhook "needs securing", implying it's built. There is **no M-Pesa code in the repo**. If the client expects a working integration, that's a from-scratch build that isn't priced.

### R4 — Credentials are already compromised
The Stripe secret key, webhook secret, and Resend API key travelled through a zip file, Fiverr chat, **and were sitting in `.env.example`** (a file normally committed to git). The client's Vercel token was also pasted into Fiverr chat. **Tell the client in writing to rotate all of them.** If that account is later abused, the record should show it was flagged.

**Severity re-checked 2026-08-23 (prefixes inspected locally, values never printed):**

| Credential | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | **`sk_test_` — test mode.** Cannot move real money. Leak is low-severity; rotate before production (T27), not urgently. |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | `whsec_` — test-mode endpoint; regenerated by `stripe listen` during dev anyway. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | **Live and confirmed working** (`GET /api-keys` → 200). Resend keys have no test mode — a leak lets anyone **send email as this account**. This is the highest-severity of the three; rotate first. |

So the original "live Stripe secret key" framing overstated Stripe and understated Resend. **Resend is the one to rotate first.**

**Resend account state (verified 2026-08-23):** `GET /domains` → `[]` — **no verified domain**, so sending is still limited to `onboarding@resend.dev`, which delivers only to the account owner's own address [R6]. Two API keys exist: `glow` (created 2026-08-14, in active use) and `glow-plus-dev` (created 2026-08-13, **never used** — a spare, safe to delete during rotation).

### R5 — Vercel cron jobs will silently not fire
`@Cron()` needs a long-running process. On Vercel serverless the four jobs **never run and never error**. Two of them are features the client specifically asked to see working (trial-ending email, points expiry). If deployed without T54, this surfaces *after* delivery as "the emails don't work."

### R6 — Email cannot be tested to real customers until a domain exists
Resend's shared `onboarding@resend.dev` sender only delivers to the Resend account owner's own address. The trial-ending and payment-failed flows can be fully verified end-to-end, but **not delivered to an arbitrary customer address** until the client buys a domain. Document this so it doesn't read as an unfinished feature.

### R7 — "Combine app and website" expectation
On 2026-08-18 the client wrote *"please combine app and website so they work together."* The current plan defers all mobile work to Order 2. That's reasonable, but the client may expect the app connected as part of the first order. **Worth confirming explicitly.**

### R8 — The mobile app's assets are missing (Order 2)
`app.json` references `./assets/icon.png`, `splash.png` and `adaptive-icon.png`. The `assets/` folder contains only `.gitkeep`. The Expo app will not build until those exist.

### R9 — Treat the docx as a narrative, not an inventory
Its actual title is **"Software Developer Project Experience & Technical Assessment"**, and it closes with *"The project demonstrates practical experience with the complete software-development lifecycle."* It reads as a reflective/portfolio write-up, which explains why it asserts things aspirationally — the frontend, the desktop app, and M-Pesa are all described as existing when they don't. **Verify every claim in it against the code before accepting it as scope.** Its backend analysis, by contrast, has proven accurate.

## 10. Open items needing the user / client

- **Rotate the Stripe and Resend keys** — they travelled through a zip and Fiverr chat, and were sitting in `.env.example`.
- **Rotate the Vercel token** the client pasted in Fiverr chat (`vcp_…`) before using it.
- **Is M-Pesa in scope?** (no code exists)
- **Confirm the website rebuild** (biggest item, absent from the client's list)
- **Vercel plan** — Hobby allows only 2 cron jobs at once-daily; this project has 4 → Pro (~$20/mo) or consolidate.
- Domain purchase — blocks production email and Stripe webhooks.
